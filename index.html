    <h1 align="center">Queen's Guitarist - Brian Harold May</h1>
    <img src="BMmodern.jpg"></img>
    <p > Brian Harold May, CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and astrophysicist. He is
      best known as the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen. He uses a home-built electric guitar called the Red
      Special.[3] His compositions for the band include "We Will Rock You", "Tie Your Mother Down", "I Want It All",
      "Fat Bottomed Girls", "Flash", "Hammer to Fall", "Save Me", "Who Wants to Live Forever", and "The Show Must Go
      On".
    </p>
    <p>
      May was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer Freddie Mercury and drummer Roger Taylor, having previously
      performed with Taylor in the band Smile, which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of
      their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player John Deacon completing the lineup, Queen had become one
      of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album A Night at the Opera and its single "Bohemian
      Rhapsody". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and
      played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at Live Aid in 1985.
      As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound
      created through his layered guitar work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the death of Mercury in 1991, Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened
      by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists. In 2005, a Planet Rock poll saw May voted
      the seventh greatest guitarist of all time.[4] He was ranked at No. 26 on Rolling Stone's list of the "100
      Greatest Guitarists of All Time".[5] In 2012, he was ranked the second greatest guitarist in a Guitar World
      magazine readers poll.[6] In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the band's
      members, and in 2018 he received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award which recognises "the most distinctive
      recordings in music history".[7]
    </p>
    <p>
      May was appointed a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 for "services to the music industry and for charity
      work".[8] May earned a PhD in astrophysics from Imperial College London in 2007,[1][2] and was Chancellor of
      Liverpool John Moores University from 2008 to 2013.[9] He was a "science team collaborator" with NASA's New
      Horizons Pluto mission.[10][11] He is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign Asteroid Day.[12] Asteroid 52665
      Brianmay was named after him. May is also an animal rights activist, campaigning against the hunting of foxes and
      the culling of badgers in the UK.[13]
